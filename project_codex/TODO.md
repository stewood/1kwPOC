# Project TODO

## üìã Guidelines and Rules

### Purpose
This TODO list serves as both a historical record and future planning tool. It maintains a complete history of all work items, decisions, and changes throughout the project's lifecycle.

### Core Principles
1. **Never Delete History**
   - Items are never deleted, only moved to COMPLETED or REMOVED
   - All status changes must be documented with dates and reasons
   - Context and decisions must be preserved

2. **Rich Context**
   - Each item must include creation date and owner
   - Document dependencies and links to relevant materials
   - Include rationale for decisions and changes
   - Cross-reference related items

3. **Clear Structure**
   - Items start in BACKLOG or NEXT
   - Active work moves to ACTIVE
   - Completed work moves to COMPLETED
   - Cancelled work moves to REMOVED with explanation
   - Only ACTIVE and NEXT items need detailed sub-tasks
   - BACKLOG items can be high-level

### Item Template
```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Item Title #ID
Status: [ACTIVE|NEXT|BACKLOG|COMPLETED|REMOVED]
Priority: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Owner: @username
Dependencies: [List of dependent items by ID]
Context: Brief explanation of why this item exists
References: Links to relevant docs/code

History:
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Created
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Status changed to X because Y

Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### Maintenance Rules
1. Review ACTIVE items daily
2. Update status changes immediately
3. Move completed items same day
4. Review priorities weekly
5. Keep NEXT queue populated
6. Monthly cleanup (move completed items to COMPLETED)
